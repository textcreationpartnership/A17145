            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Euen ſo how theſe ſinnes abound at this time in this land, I thinke there are but few, but doe ſee: and none that truely feareth God, but doth lament. To omit other ſinnes here mentioned, as then there were which worſhipped <hi>Iehoua</hi> the onely true God, and <hi>Malcham</hi> their Idoll: euen ſo there be now not a few, which to pleaſe the Prince and State pretend outwardly to like of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed, and yet inwardly in their hearts fauour Idolatrie and wicked worſhippings repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſame. And as then many were turned backe from after God, and ſought him not, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after him: euen ſo now there are many which be reuolted from Gods holy worſhip agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his word, and vtterly forſake the holy aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where Gods word is truly preached, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are according to Chriſts inſtitution rightly miniſtred, and Gods holy name faithfully called vpon. Theſe with <hi>Lots</hi> wife looke backe vnto<note place="margin">Geneſ. 19. Numb. 14.</note> Sodome: and are with the Iſraelites in heart turned back into Egypt, deſiring rather to eate onions and garlike there, then to feed vpon the heauenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Gods bleſſed word.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7248:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Of theſe thus turned backe from ſeeking after God, they be moſt dangerous, which being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues, endeuour by all meanes both by ſpeaking and writing to ſeduce and deceiue others. Such be the Seminarie Prieſts and Ieſuites, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be at this preſent time (at leaſtwiſe in outward apparance) at deadly fewd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, writing moſt bittely one againſt another: yet they all agree in reſiſting Gods truth, ſeducing the ſimple and in labouring moſt earneſtly to ſet vp againe their Dagon of the Maſſe fallen downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke of Chriſts Goſpell. To this end they write lewd, lying, and ſlanderous Pamphlets, wherein they traduce the truth, and faithfull fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers thereof, deceiue the ignorant, and confirme in error their ouer affectioned fauorers, who without triall or examination ouer raſhly receiue, and ouer lightly beleeue whatſoeuer is broached by them.</p>
            <p>Of theſe lying Libels there came one to my hands a yeere paſt and more, pretended to be printed at Antwerpe 1600. wherein is boldly affirmed, but faintly proued, that we haue no faith, nor religion: that of vs both the learned, and ignorant of the Greeke and Latine tongues be Infidels: that wee know not what wee beleeue: that we are bound in conſcience both neuer to aske forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and alſo to auoide all good workes: that we make God the author of ſinne, and worſe then the diuell. Theſe and ſuch other ſhameles aſſertions and falſe ſlanders when I read, it came into my heart, that Maſter <hi>Thomas Wright</hi> (with whoſe ſpirit I had beene acquainted) was the venter of this ware. In which opinion I was afterward confirmed, for that
<pb facs="tcp:7248:4"/> both ſome of his fauourers could not denie it, and in a written copie therof taken in a ſearch in Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and ſent vnto me, theſe two letters, <hi>T. W.</hi> were ſet in the end of it.</p>
            <p>This lewd Libell although in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter voide both of truth and learning, deſerued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be deſpiſed, then earneſtly anſwered: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the author of it, thinketh ſo highly of himſelf, and ſo baſely and contemptuouſly of vs, giuing out in certaine written conferences, which he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad in this land, and ſome faithfull men haue ſeene, that wee be vnlearned, and ſo giuen to wordly affaires, that we beſtow no time, or but little in ſtudie: I (although the meaneſt and vnmeeteſt of many) was moued to wtite this anſwere, thereby to confute theſe calumnies, to cleere the truth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faithfull, and if by Gods gracious bleſſing it might be, to reclaime and reforme the ignorant and ſeduced. Whereof I haue the leſſe hope, for that as they imitate thoſe wicked Iſraelits, <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, turned away their ſhoulder, ſtopped their</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oued and reloued friend, I haue receiued your courteous letter, wherein you greatly wonder, that I wondred ſo much in our laſt diſcourſe; that any man in England endued with a good iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, conioined with a religious conſcience,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7248:8"/> could either accept, or affect the Proteſtants new coyned goſpell. You requeſt me to ſet downe briefly ſuch reaſons as induced me therevnto: the which ſuite I could not deny: for both religion and affection vrged me to ſatisfie ſo iuſt a deſire. For I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I loue you as a man, and as an honeſt ciuill Gentleman, &amp; moſt gladly I would haue occaſion to loue you as a Catholike Gentleman: for it is great pitty that ſuch a multitude of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable errors, and heynous hereſies ſhould lodge in ſo rarely qualified a ſoule. I haue penned them after an accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following the faſhion of ſchooles, in moſt of them after a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſticall method: to the intent that if you ſhould ſhew them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Miniſters, which ſwarme about you, they might not haue ſuch free ſcope and liberty, to range abroad with their idle diſcourſes (as they vſe to take) veiling their confuſed conceits with a multitude of affected phraſes: thereby more eaſily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſimple, &amp; loath the learned. Wherefore I beſeech you if any ſuch itching ſpirit ſhall attempt an anſwer, to intreat him to performe it briefly, orderly, &amp; ſeriouſly. This I requeſt, for that I perceiue that Proteſtants cannot anſwer with breuity, becauſe their religion lacketh both certainty and perſpicuitie: And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hard or impoſſible it is to reply without prolixitie, where there is no truth nor verity. And therefore I requeſt you as you loue me, to will them to conſider well, before they anſwer ill: and not to reply with raſhnes, leaſt they retract with deliberation, to their vtter ſhame &amp; confuſion. And that you may perceiue how my wonder rather deſerued approbation then admiration &amp; for that order is a fauorit of memory: I thought good to reduce all my reaſons into two heads; wit and will, knowledge &amp; affection, faith and good life: becauſe the nature of hereſie hath euer been ſuch as did not only inueagle the wit with errors, but alſo ſeduce the will with occaſions of inordinate affections. I ſay then that no excellent good wit, linked with a religious conſcience, can accept nor affect the Proteſtants new coyned goſpell: for good wits and iudgments, aſſiſted with Gods grace, may eaſily conceiue the truth, yea by the force of their very naturall faculties, they may iudge credibly of the truth once propoſed; &amp; without great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty diſcerne the abſurdities of an vntrue religion. Vertuous and well inclined affections which are the baſe of quiet, ſecure,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7248:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> and religious conſciences, abhor and deteſt ſuch principles as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſhonor God, abaſe mans nature, occaſion ſinne, fauor ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or any ſort diminiſh deuotion, or piety: And therefore all the inſequent articles ſhall ſtand vpon theſe two foundations, to wit, that the Proteſtants religion debarreth the wit from right vnderſtanding the true faith, and the will from following of any vertue or godlineſſe.</hi>

Whereas you requeſt that hee that ſhall anſwere this your pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, will doe <hi>it briefely, orderly, and ſeriouſly,</hi> I will inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor to doe the two laſt as GOD ſhall inable me.

But whereas you ſay, that you make this requeſt, for that you perceiue that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <hi>cannot anſwere with breuitie, becauſe their Religion lacketh both certaintie and perſpicuitie:</hi> I ſay that with one breath you doe vtter two vntruthes. The firſt that wee cannot anſwere with breuitie, which how vntrue it is, let it be tried firſt by the briefe and pithy anſweres of that great learned man Doctor <hi>Fulke:</hi> who anſwering many of their bookes, which yet to this day ſtand vndefended, how briefely and pithily hee anſwered the ſame, let any man that hath but a graine of indifferent iudgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and iudge. And particularlie I referre them to his anſwere to <hi>Riſhtons</hi> challenge, and to <hi>Allens</hi> booke of Purgatorie, both in one volume: yea many times in his writings hee called them from long and impertinent diſcourſes, to ſhort ſyllogiſmes, wherevnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How cloſely that pretious <hi>Iewell</hi> and excellent ornament of this Church of <hi>England</hi> did hold himſelfe to the matter, and how vnlike hee was to Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> in his long diſcourſes and digreſsions, who in his booke intituled, A detection of lies, &amp;c. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed two hundred and ſixe whole ſides of paper, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in preambles and prefaces, before hee once ſtept into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7248:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> his matter, as Maiſter <hi>Iewel</hi> truely told him; let the vpright<note place="margin">Preface to the defence of the Apology edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 2.</note> reader indifferently iudge. The like I may ſay of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie man of famous memorie, Doctor <hi>Whitakers,</hi> who how briefely, ſoundlie, and learnedlie hee hath anſwered <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, Saunders, Duree, Stapleton, William Reynolds,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> any man that hath an incorrupt eye may ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. And if <hi>T. W.</hi> bee the author of this pamphlet (as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt but hee is) he may remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that one which had conference with him, did write a briefe Epiſtle vnto him, and did therein ſet downe ſhort ſillogiſmes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the controuerſies of praier to Saints, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and required to haue the like ſhort ſyllogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſet downe of him for the defence of his aſſertions, and could not receiue one, but along tedious diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning praier to Saints, which was confuted, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer defended. But whether anſweres be briefe or long, it maketh no matter, ſo that they be learned, ſound and true, to the effectuall confuting of the errour, and ſatisfying of the reader. Now as touching certaintie which you ſay, but doe not ſhew, that our Religion lacketh: I anſwere and auouch that our Religion is farre more certaine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant, and agreeable to it ſelfe, then the doctrine of the Church of Rome is: the which if I do not effectually proue hereafter in place more conuenient, I will not require any man (to vſe your owne words) to accept, or affect it. But with what forehead can this man charge our doctrine with want of perſpicuitie, ſeeing hee cannot bee ignorant how obſcure, darke, and intricate the popiſh Religion and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is; as may appeere by their manifold, both curious queſtions, and intricate diſtinctions, which be their chiefe ſhifts, to elude the plaine truth. And if any would ſee how darke the doctrine and writings of Papiſts are, let him looke into the Schoolemen, <hi>Tho. Aquine, Io Scotus, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander de Hales, Gabriel Biel,</hi> and many ſuch other, amongſt whom he may finde as much certaintie, vnitie, and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie of doctrine, as hee may in hell. But how we ſtudy for perſpicuitie, and ſeeke to make all matters plaine, both in our preachings, and in our writings, auoyding all curious
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7248:11"/> queſtions, and intricate and needleſſe diſtinctions; we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the conſciences of al that reade, and heare vs. As touching your method concerning errours in doctrine, and inordinate affections in manners, if you can proue, that our wits be inueigled with them, and our liues ſtained with theſe, more then wee can prooue euen your holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Popes, forſooth <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, and Chriſtes vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars haue beene, you ſhall winne the victorie. You ſeeme to attribute too much to our very naturall faculties, to the iudging and diſcerning of truth propoſed, not conſidering the corruption of our naturall faculties by ſinne, how both the minde is blinded, and the will peruerted.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7248:19"/> therefore wee build vpon our owne priuate expoſition.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7248:20"/> the bookes of the ſcriptures (as the Fathers did) but onely examined ſome places, and diſcuſſed ſome Doctrines which were in controuerſie. Moreouer, whereas Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his foure bookes <hi>de doctrina chriſtiana</hi> entreateth large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the expoſition of the Scriptures, and giueth many good and learned leſſons concerning the ſame, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeauen rules of <hi>Ticonius</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth, and calleth them keyes to open the ſcripture: neither he, nor <hi>Ticonius</hi> doe make mention of theſe rules, which the author of this pamphlet doth here ſet downe, nor referre vs vnto them.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7248:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> reader ſee, who they bee which follow priuate and falſe expoſitions of the Scriptures; and conſequently be infidels. And if the author of this pamphlet, or his companions, can charge vs with the like, then they may truly ſay that we haue followed priuate expoſitions, and be Infidels. But it is the vſuall manner of theſe men to make many vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accuſations, and to bring few ſound proofes.</p>
                  <p>Where you ſay that we reiect Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and other Fathers, who bring Scripture to proue prayer for the dead, I anſwer, that we refuſe not the alledging of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by any, but vpon good and ſound reaſon, which we will be ready to iuſtifie and maintaine. If you thinke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in that booke <hi>de cura pro mortuis</hi> which you quote (which is more full of doubts, then of ſound proofes out of the Scripture) or other Fathers haue any plaine places of Scripture to prooue prayer for the dead, you may produce them, vrge them, and make ſyllogiſmes of them, and we will anſwer them. But you ſpeake many things generally, and proue few particularly and pithily: For vs to proue and examine by the Scriptures, the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Fathers, is no fault. For if the ſpirit of God commend that good people of Berea for examining <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching by the Scriptures, we cannot be worthily bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> for examining the writings and expoſitions of the Fathers by the Scriptures, as long as it cannot be proued, that we doe otherwaies, then accept the good, and reiect the euill. So Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaking of the writings of Godly Fathers ſaith: <hi>Hoc genus literarum ab autoritate canonis diſting uendum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> This kind of writing is to be diſtinguiſhed from the authority of the canon of the<note place="margin">Auguſt. epiſt 48.</note> Scriptures. For they be not ſo read as though a teſtimonie were ſo aleaged out of them, that we may not thinke or iudge other-wiſe, if they haue any where other-waies thought then the truth required. For we are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them which doe not diſdaine to accept to our ſelues that which was ſaid of the Apoſtle. If you be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded GOD ſhall reueale the ſame vnto you. The like he writeth in his 111. epiſtle to <hi>Fortunatianus,</hi> and in

To conclude, if you can produce any expoſitions of the ancient Fathers (whom we reuerence, and whoſe workes wee read as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenty as you doe) which we reiect, if we do not ſhew good reaſon for the ſame, let vs beare the blame, and ſhame of it.

Now how ſhall an Engliſh Catholike, that vnderſtandeth not the Latine know whether the ſame bee truely tranſlated out of the Latine or no, or ſhall his faith here rely vpon the credit and fidelitie of the tranſlator? I would know what difference there is betweene ſuch a one reading or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that tranſlation, and one of vs reading or hearing ours: And why the faith of the one doth more depend
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7248:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> on the credit and fidelity of the tranſlator, then the other. Surely this difference there is, that our tranſlations bee true, and agreeable to the originall of the Greeke, wherein the holy Ghoſt indited, and the Apoſtles did write the new Teſtament: and their ſaid Remiſh tranſlation is falſe differing from the ſame, in contradictions, addiitons, and detractions in very many places, as I haue ſhewed in a diſcourſe thereof added to the confutation of the ten fooliſh reaſons, which the Remiſts vſe in the preface of the Teſtament by them ſet forth, which moued them in tranſlating to leaue the originall fountaine of the Greeke, and to follow the corrupt ſtreame of the Latine, which hath bene extant in print theſe twelue yeares, and yet to this day neuer anſwered. Now as touching the decree of the councell of Trident for the Latine, made by about fourty blind Biſhops or Buſſards, I ſay, it is a ſhamefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and a fit one for ſuch a councel, and ſuch a one as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhewed in any of all the councels, that haue bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Church of Chriſt, to authorize a tranſlation ſo much differing and diſſenting from the Hebrew &amp; Greeke as it doth, to be authenticall, that is, to haue authority of it ſelfe, and not to be refuſed in any readings, preachings, &amp;c. the which tranſlation is ſo corrupt and full of faults, that <hi>Iſiodorus Clarus</hi> a Spaniſh Biſhop profeſſeth that he found eight thouſand faults in it: the which preface of his as they haue ſince ſuppreſſed, ſo it is written that the Spaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors<note place="margin">Amand. Po<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lanus in didaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calia pag. 49.</note> plagued him for it. But to admit that this Latine tranſlation is authenticall as the Tridentine councell hath decreed: I would aske one of theſe Catholikes vpon what edition thereof they will relie their faith, whether that which of late yeares was ſet out at Rome by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, or another two or three yeares after, by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the eight. The which editions do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ in alterations, additions, detractions, contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Maiſter <hi>Thomas Iames</hi> hath very diligently, and largely ſhewed. The former, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift had as hee profeſſeth ſuch care to haue the Bible vncoruptly ſet fourth and printed, that he corrected the faults with

Surely what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you will herein confeſſe, both this their moulding, and the booke it ſelfe did plainly ſhew, that it was become very mouldy and corrupt, and full of foule faults as ſundry Papiſts haue acknowledged.

                  <p>Aud therefore vntill you haue anſwered the ſame, you may bee aſhamed to brag of his pregnant proofs, which were ſo weake, and cauils ſo greatand many, that he rather diſcouered his own folly; then diſcredited our tranſlators. What Maiſter <hi>Broughton</hi> writeth concerning our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I doe not knowe, neither do I greatly care: yet this I ſay, although that our tranſlations were made in the feare of God, to profit Gods Church and people, according to the meaſure of the grace of God beſtowed vpon the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in that holy worke, and be voyd of wilfull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either for doctrine or manners: yet I do not thinke them to be voyde of imperfections, in reſpect of propriety of words, and phraſes, wherein they may be ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and amended. And hard it is to haue a tranſlation ſo exact and perfit, but that ſome ſuch imperfectnes may be in it, which yet be not repugnant either to holy doctrine or good life. And for aſmuch as this man of malice would faine if hee could diſcredit our tranſlations, and cauſe the

This tranſlation hee did dedicate to Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the feauenth: Let the Reader compare our tranſlations, eſpecially of the latter editions with the ſaid tranſlation, and ſee whether in any ſubſtantiall matter of faith and life, hee can finde any corruptions and any great and notorious diſſenſions from the ſame. And the like I may ſay of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Teſtament dedicated to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and allowed by him. Let (Iſay) the Reader compare our tranſlations with theſe, and although hee may finde ſome difference in words and phraſes, yet in matters of ſubſtance which concerne either the doctrine of faith, or precepts of good life, I am ſure hee ſhall finde a goodly and Godly harmonie and agreement to his comfort and contentation. And laſtly I wil offer to this challenger, (who offereth challenge of diſputation with vs) and to al his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, that for one fault of moment or weight, that they ſhall finde in our tranſlation, eſpecially, as I ſaid of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter editions, wherein they differ from the originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Hebrew and Greeke; I will vndertake to finde ſixe, yea ten greater and fouler in that vulgar Latine tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, which the councell of Trident hath moſt abſurdly confirmed and made authentical: And therefore let neither the Godly Chriſtian Reader, nor the ſeduced Catholike, be diſſwaded from reading of our tranſlations, nor doubt of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7248:30"/> the truth of them. But this hath beene in all ages the drift of the Diuell to ſeeke to diſcredite and diffame thoſe Godly men that haue labored in Gods vineyard, and haue indeuored to tranſlate his holy word to the comfort and ſaluation of his elect and choſen people. How Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> of old; and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of late were vſed, I haue elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewed.

Againe are you not bound to beleeue the canticles or ſong of <hi>Salomon</hi> as a part of your faith, and where finde you in the ſcriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered that ſuch a booke is Gods word, and as ſuch an one ought by faith to bee beleeued? That Sunday ſhould bee kept holy-daie, and Saterdaie the Iewes Saboth prophained, in Gods word is not reuealed, and yet by Proteſtants beleeued. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to beleeue whatſoeuer is contained in the ſcripture, is a generall, confuſed, folded implicitie faith: when wee demaund what a man is bound to beleeue, wee aske what hee is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to beleeue expreſly, diſtinctlie, explicitlie. To beleeue all the ſcripture diſtinctly, explicitly cannot bee preformed by all Proteſtants, ſince it ſuppoſeth a perfect and diſtinct knowledge of all the ſcripture, wherevnto neuer mortall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7248:31"/> man attained, the Apoſtles perhaps excepted.</q> Some will li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their beleefe to their creed, ſaying, that nothing ought to be beleeued which is not in the Apoſtles creed. But then I would demaund of them, whether that wee ought to beleeue that the ſcripture is the word of God? that baptiſme is a ſacrament? that in the Euchariſt is the bodie of Chriſt by faith? to what article ſhould theſe be reduced, ſeeing they are not contained in the creed? or how ſhall we know infallibly, how theſe be matters of faith: ſince they are not contained in the creed? others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſome articles of their creed alſo: for the Proteſtants denie three articles of our creed, and the puritans fiue. The firſt is the Catholike Church. <hi>Credo eccleſiam ſanctam Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam:</hi> I beleeue the holie Catholike Church, the which in very<note place="margin">Math. 26. Iſa. 60.</note> deede they doe not beleeue: becauſe Catholike is vniuerſall, and ſo the Church of Chriſt which wee are bound to beleeue, muſt bee vniuerſall for all time comprehending all ages, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall for place, comprehending all nations: but that Church which the Proteſtants beleeue, was interrupted all the ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Apoſtles and <hi>Luther,</hi> which was 1400. yeares, or in verie deed was neuer ſeene before <hi>Luthers</hi> daies, therefore that Church they beleeue, cannot bee Catholike. Neither is it vniuerſali in place, beeing contained within the narrow bounds of England, which is accompted but as a corner of the world, for the Lutherans in Germanie, the Hugonotes in France, and the Gues in Flanders deteſt their Religion as much as the Catholikes; neither will they ioyne iſſue with them in diuers eſſentiall points. And therefore the Proteſtants Church which they beleeue, can no more be called Catholike or vniuerſall, then England the vniuerſall world: or Kent the Kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: or apruned bough a whole tree, or a dead ſinger a man, or a rotten tooth, the whole head. The ſecond article is the communion of Saints, the which they many waies deny. Firſt by not beleeuing that Chriſt hath inſtituted ſeauen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein the Saints of the Church communicate: and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie the true and real preſence of our Sauiour Chriſt in the Euchariſt, by which all the faithfull receiuers participating of<note place="margin">1.

Apoca. 1. v. 4.</note> and triumphant by exclaiming againſt inuocation of Saints, by which holy exerciſe the bleſſed Saints in heauen and wee in earth communicate; we by prayer glorifying them, and they by meditation, obtaining our requeſt. Thirdly, they deny the communion of the Church militant, and the ſoules in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, bereauing them of that Chriſtian charitie, which chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table compaſſion and merciful pitty requireth, and by natural affection the members of one body helpe one another. The third article is remiſſion of ſinnes, for they acknowledge no ſuch effect in the Sacrament of Baptiſme: but onely count it as an external ſigne, or ſeale of a prereceiued grace or fauor of God,<note place="margin">Ad Tit. 3.</note> by his external predeſtination, againſt the expreſſe word of God: which therefore calleth this Sacrament the lauer of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> for that in it the ſoule (dead by ſinne) is newly regenerate by grace. Moreouer they allow not the Sacrament of pennance, wherein all actuall ſinnes committed after Baptiſme are can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, &amp; that which exceedeth all in abſurditie, is to deny that our ſinnes are all perfectly forgiuen, but onely not imputed, and as it were veiled or couered with the paſſion of Chriſt: all the botches, and biles the filth and abhomination of ſinne ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and as it were exhaling a moſt peſtiferous ſent in the ſight of God: for let them ſhift themſelues as they liſt, and ſcarfe their ſores according to their fancies, yet no veile, nor mantell can couer their deformitie of ſinne, from the piercing eyes of<note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, the Puritanes in effect deny that Christ is the Sonne of God: for they peremptorily affirme that Chriſt is God of himſelfe, and not God of God: So that he receiued not his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from his father. The which poſition flatly taketh away the nature of a ſonne, for the nature of a ſonne is to receiue his ſubſtance of his Father, and it implyeth contradiction: that the Sonne receiueth his perſon of his Father and not his ſubſtance and eſſence, for the ſubstance of God is eſſentiall to euery perſon in trinitie. Fiftly, finally they deny the deſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt into hell, and deſperately defend that he ſuffered the Paines of hell vpon the Croſſe, wherby they blaſpheme moſt horribly that ſacred humanitie: as if Chriſt had diſpaired of

                  <p>And whereas you would make men beleeue, that the Church whereof wee are, is contained within the narrow boundes of England, and that the Lutherans in Germanie, the Hugonotes in France, and the Gues in Flanders (as you tearme them) will not ioyne iſſue with vs in diuers eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall pointes of Religion, you doe to the offending of God, and deceiuing of your ignorant reader, vtter two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious vntruths.

But how doe you truely confeſſe the Church to be Catholike, that is, vniuerſall, comprehending all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in reſtraining it to the religion and ſubiection of the Pope of Rome, and ſo conſequently to a ſmall part of Europe? vnleſſe you will now of late adde the Weſt Indians, where the Spaniards haue committed moe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible murthers, then they haue made good proſelytes. And what an improper ſpeech it is, that you cal the Church of Rome the Catholik church, as if a man ſhold cal the church of Corinth or Epheſus the Catholike, that is the vniuerſall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7248:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church, which if they were holy, are but members of the Catholike Church. This is therefore that which you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly attribute to vs, to call England the vniuerſall world: or Kent the kingdome of England, &amp;c. But the Church of Rome now committing fornication with ſtocks and ſtones is ſo farre from being the Catholike Church, that it is no true member thereof, as M.

And that theſe whom you contemptuouſly cal Lutherans, Hugonotes, and Gues, do diſſent from vs in eſſentiall points of religion, you may eaſily affirme, but ſhall neuer be able to proue. Some indeed in Germany, whome you call Lutherans, do diſſent from vs in one point concerning the Sacrament of Chriſts body and bloud: howbeit you cannot be ignorant, but that many Churchs and countries in Germany ioyne with vs in that matter. And let the reader reade and examine the confeſſions of faith ſet out by the Churches in France, and in the low countries, and they ſhall ſee both how great their agreement in Doctrine is with vs, and alſo what a ſhameleſſe ſlaunder this is, which this authour hath) acording to his accuſtomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) auouched, but not proued.

And this offer I do make you, that if you can bring one plaine place out of all the holy ſcriptures, wherein it was euer commaunded, or of any faithfull man or woman vſed, I will yeeld vnto you not onely in this, but alſo in matters of Religion.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7248:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God twiſe repeated, and the onely begotten ſonne of GOD, vnder the name of the Angell. For by the Angell he vnderſtandeth the redeemer, the word of GOD, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour or the miniſter of GODS helpe and diſpenſation; euen he, I ſay, bleſſe theſe children.

This phraſe of ſpeech is ſo vſed in other places of Scripture as <hi>Iſa. 41. In that day ſeuen women ſhall lay hold of one man, ſaying, we will eate our owe bread, and we will weare our owne garments: onely let thy name be called vpon vs, and take away our reproch.</hi> Whereby is meant, that hee ſhould bee their husband, and they counted and called his wiues. The like phraſe is 2. <hi>Sam. 12. 28.

The words of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> be theſe: <hi>Iohn to the ſeuen Churches which are in Aſia, Grace be with you and peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the ſeuen ſpirits which are before his throne, and from Ieſus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> What meaneth this man to alledge this for inuocation of Saints? will he by theſe ſeauen ſpirits vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Saints? either he knoweth little, or he cannot
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7248:43"/> be ignorant that this is expounded of the holy Ghoſt, who although he be in perſon one, yet by the communication of his vertue, and demonſtration of his diuine workes in thoſe ſeauen Churches, doth ſo perfectly ſhew himſelfe, as though there were ſo many ſpirits, euery one working in his peculiar Church. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſet out by Doctor <hi>Tunſtall</hi> Biſhop of Dureſme writeth vpon theſe words thus. <hi>Hic tota trinit as demonſtratur:</hi> Heere the whole Trinitie is ſhewed: and a little after: <hi>Per ſeptem autem ſpiritus, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſanctus cò quòd ſit ſeptiformis intelligitur:</hi> By the ſeauen ſpirits the holy Ghoſt is vnderſtood, becauſe hee worketh ſeauen manner of wayes. And hard it were, or rather ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to pray for grace and peace from Saints, and that before Ieſus Chriſt. But vpon this I will not ſtand; onely the reader may conſider how barren this cauſe is, which hath no plainer proofes, and driueth this man to ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and falſe expoſition of Gods word.

As touching the Saints mediation, when Ieſus Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to be our mediator, and to ſit at the right hand of GOD to make interceſſion for vs, then wee wil ſeeke to your mediation of Saints. In the meane time take you heede, that in attributing that to the Saints, which is proper and peculiar to the ſonne of GOD, yea which hee hath bought with his bloud, you doe not deny the Lord which hath bought vs, and that you doe not horribly diſhonor thoſe Saints, and make Idols of them. Furthermore you ſay that wee deny the communion of the Church militant, and the ſoules in purgatorie, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7248:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> I anſwer, that when you ſhal plainely &amp; pithily proue this your fained fire of purgatorie (which the Greeke Church alwaies hath denied) then we will yeeld vnto you, and graunt our ſelues to bee to blame, in not helping theſe ſeely ſoules with dirges, maſſes, &amp;c. out of the paines of this forged fire. You quote in your margent for proofe thereof, 1. <hi>Cor. 3. v. 15. &amp; 15. v.</hi> 29. Alas poore purgatory, that hath no better proofes. The words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt place be theſe: <hi>If a mans worke burne, he ſhall loſe, but he ſhall be ſaued himſelfe: neuertheleſſe yet as it were by fire.</hi> Here is mention of fire, and therefore it muſt needs be the fire of purgatory: for ſuch is the great iudgement of theſe worthy writers, that if they read in the ſcriptures or Fathers this word fire, it is none other but the fire of purgatorie: if ſacrifice, it is the ſacrifice of the Maſſe: if confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it can be nothing but auricular confeſſion to the Prieſt: if tradition, it is vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verities or vanities. But touching theſe places of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe the author of this Pamphlet doth not aledge them, but barely quote them, I will but briefely touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To the firſt I ſay, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaketh not of all men, but only of teachers and preachers, which be builders of Gods houſe and Church, which euen <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.<note place="margin">Tom 1. contr. 6 de purgat. lib. 1 cap. 4.</note> Secondly, he ſpeaketh not of all their workes, but only of their doctrine whereby they build the Church of God. Thirdly, hee ſpeaketh not of the purging of workes or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons but of the probation of doctrines. Fourthly, the works are ſaid to bee prooued, and not the perſons. Laſtly, if this place ſhould be vnderſtood of purgatory, then euery man ſhould bee throwne into it, for it is ſaid the fire ſhall try euery mans worke of what ſort it is: but this is contrarie to the doctrine of the Papiſts, who will not haue all men come into purgatorie. Theſe things plainely ſhew that this place cannot bee vnderſtood of purgatorie: Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in many places doth vnderſtand it of the afflictions and troubles ſuſtained in this life, and not of the paines of Purgatorie after this life, <hi>Enchir. ad Laurentium cap. 68. de ciuit. Dei lib. 21. cap. 26. de fide &amp; operibus cap. 16. in Pſal.</hi> 80. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of triall of doctrine, ſhewing that as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7248:44"/> the fire trieth mettals, ſo the light of Gods truth trieth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: and as gold and ſiluer abide in the fire, and hay and ſtubble be conſumed: ſo true, ſound, and holie doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines abide the light and trial of Gods word; when either vntrue doctrines or vaine ſpeculations periſh and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. So doth Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expound it: <hi>Mala doctrina</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambroſ. in 1. Cor. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>in igne omnibus apparebit, nunc enim quoſdam fallit:</hi> Euill doctrine ſhall appeare vnto all in the fire, for now it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth ſome. Againe, <hi>Mala enim &amp; adultera doctrina id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circo in ligno, foeno, &amp; ſtipula ſignificata eſt, vt oſtenderetur ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis eſſe eſca:</hi> Euill and counterfeit doctrine is therefore ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by wood, hay, and ſtubble, that it might be ſhewed,<note place="margin">Idem. in Pſal. 118. in haec verba, ignitum eloquiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuum.</note> that it is but meate to bee conſumed of fire. And againe, <hi>Ignis ergo hic Chriſti ſermo eſt: &amp; bonus ignis, &amp;c.</hi> This fire is the word of Chriſt, and it is a good fire, which warmeth, but burneth not but onely ſinnes. By this fire that gold of the Apoſtle laid vpon the good foundation is tried. By this fire that ſiluer of manners or workes is proued. By this fire thoſe pretious ſtones are lightned: but the hay &amp; ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is conſumed. Therefore this fire clenſeth the ſoule, and conſumeth error. Hitherto Saint <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> whereby wee may ſee that neither Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expound this place of Purgatory, much leſſe the Greeke Fathers, who neuer acknowledged it. Therfore to expound it of Purgatorie, as the Papiſts do, whether it bee not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate &amp; falſe expoſition, let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly reader vprightly iudge.</p>
                  <p>The words of the other place here quoted are theſe: <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do, which are baptized for the dead: if the dead riſe not at all, why are they then baptized for dead?</hi> To picke Purgatorie pickpurſe out of this place paſſeth my skill. Here is mention made of baptiſme for the dead: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Purgatorie, nor of praier for the dead. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that there bee ſundrie expoſitions of this place: yet I doe not remember that euer I read it expounded of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, or applied vnto it. And therefore I will write no more at this preſent of it, but wil expect a ſyllogiſme to bee made of it for the proofe of Purgatorie, and then I ſhall further conſider what to ſay vnto it. Wee do beleeue that

They therefore that bee in Purgarorie, bee no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie, nor are to bee deliuered by him: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes creatures, are either by him (who can at his pleaſure emptie and ſcoure Purgatorie) to bee deliuered, or elſe ſtill in that fained fire to be tormented. Neither hath true Chriſtian charitie ſo much, as the curſed couetouſneſſe of Prieſts, beene the bellowes to blow that forged fire for the heating of their kitchens.</p>
                  <p>Now that I haue anſwered your reaſonleſſe reaſons of our denying this article of Chriſtian faith, the communion of Saints, I will briefly ſhew what is our beleefe of it. Wee beleeue that all the Saints of God, and members of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Catholike Church haue communion and fellowſhippe with Ieſus Chriſt, and are partakers of all his benefits. Of this communion Chriſt ſpeaketh: <hi>I am the vine, yee are the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 5</note> 
                     <hi>branches: hee that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth much fruite.</hi> Of this ſpeaketh S. <hi>Paul: God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>by whom yee are called vnto the fellowſhip of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This communion or fellowſhip is wrought by faith, by the which Chriſt dwelleth in the hearts of all<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 17.</note> his elect and faithfull people, and by which wee be graffed into him to receiue all grace and goodnes from him as the branch doth from the vine or ſtocke. And we beleeue that all the faithfull and Godly bee knit togither in loue, as the<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 2</note> Apoſtle ſpeaketh, whereby they are to communicate thoſe graces and gifts, which God hath beſtowed vpon them, to the edifying and helping of others, in ſuch ſort as GOD hath appointed. Yea wee beleeue that all the faithfull haue communion and fellowſhip together in that they haue all one heauenly father, one Ieſus Chriſt their redeemer and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7248:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> mediator, one holy Ghoſt their ſanctifier, are iuſtified by one faith common to all the elect, dedicated to GOD by one baptiſme, called by one Goſpell to bee partakers of one kingdome of glory. This is the ſumme of our beleefe concerning this article, wherein wee would know what fault you can finde? But your communion and vnion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in being vnder one Pope of Rome, vnder whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedince whoſoeuer is not, you thinke he cannot be ſaued, as is before ſhewed; neither will you haue communion with him: And therefore whereas Chriſtianity hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (as I ſaid before) in Greece, Ruſſia, Aethiopia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, and other countries amongſt whome no doubt but God hath had, and now hath his elect and choſen people, yet you haue no communion or felloſhip with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be not vnder your one Pope. And much leſſe haue you communion with the Saints in heauen, becauſe you haue not the faith of Gods elect. For did the faithfull Patriakes, Prophets, Apoſtles and others beleeue to bee deliuered from the fire of hell by the merits of <hi>Nicholas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Titus. 1. 1.</note> or to aſcend into heauen by the blood of <hi>Thomas Becket?</hi> Nay Ieſus Chriſt is the onely mercy ſeate, into the which the two Cherubins did looke, that is, as I take it, both the faithfull before his comming in the fleſh, and they that be after doe looke only vpon Chriſt, in him onely to ſeeke and finde mercy.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee the third article of our Creed, which you ſay we deny, which is Remiſſion of ſinnes. Here I beſeech the Chriſtian reader to conſider who they bee that deny this article, containing a principall point of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſaluation, whether we or this accuſer with his partners. Wee beleeue, that whereas we be children, of wrath, vnprofitable ſeruants, and prodigall children that haue ſinned againſt heauen and our heauenly father, and are ſo deepely indebted to God, that we be neuer able to make payment, for the which he might iuſtly throw vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dungeon of damnation for euer: wee I ſay beleeue that he hath giuen <hi>his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>

                     <hi>forgiuenes of ſinnes, according to his rich grace, and that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs for his names ſake.</hi> And we beleeue that God of his great mercy in Ieſus Chriſt doth forgiue vs not onely our ſinnes, but alſo the puniſhment due vnto them, and which we haue deſerued by them, accepting vs for veſſels of his mercy, and heires of his glory. Now this accuſer of vs, and his companions doe firſt beleeue, that they doe make ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice for their ſinnes. For whereas our ſinnes be called debts, and ſatisfaction is a payment; it followeth, that if we doe make ſatisfaction for them, then we neither need, nor can haue forgiueneſſe of them. For our ſatisfaction, and Gods forgiueneſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together. For euen as if I owe a man a hundreth pounds, and I pay him, he doth not forgiue it; and if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue it, I do not pay it: So if we by ſatisfaction make pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to GOD for our ſinnes, then hee doth not forgiue them; if he forgiue them, then wee doe not make ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee, what is the doctrine of theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this their ſatisfaction, whereby they make pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelues to God for their debts. Biſhoppe <hi>Fiſher,</hi> whome I ſuppoſe the Pope hath fainted for ſtanding ſo<note place="margin">John Fiſher in Pſa. 1. poenitent</note> ſtifly in his cauſe, writeth hereof thus: <hi>Thirdly, ſome there be, which by grace in this life haue ſo puniſhed them-ſelues for their offences, that they haue made a ſufficient recompence for</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jbidem.</note> 
                     <hi>them</hi> Againe: <hi>So doth hearty weeping for ſinne, expell ſinne, &amp; is a ſufficient &amp; iuſt recompence for it.</hi> And againe: <hi>But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Pſa. 2. poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> 
                     <hi>any creature hath made due ſatisfaction in this life, he neuer after that ſhall ſuffer more paine and alſo is cleane out of debt, and nothing after that ſhall euer bee claimed of him.</hi> Againe, <hi>They bee called</hi> recti corde, <hi>that haue made ſatisfaction ſo</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jbidem.</note> 
                     <hi>plentifully, that God can aske no more of them.</hi> And in his Latine booke againſt <hi>Luther</hi> he hath theſe words: <hi>Secundo ſupponimus, quod quanquam nemo ſit cui non cumulatius praemium in coelis Deus largiatur, quàm hic in terris ipſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Idem in confut aſſert. Luther. articulo. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>innumeri tamen ſunt, qui longè grauiores aerumnas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerunt quàm ad ſuorum ſuffeciſſent delictorum expiationem:</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:7248:46"/> Secondly, wee make this ſuppoſition, that although there is none, to whome God doth not giue a greater reward in Heauen, then hee hath merited and deſerued: yet there bee many which haue ſuffered farre more grieuous griefes and puniſhments, then would haue ſufficed to the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purging away their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>This is their doctrine, and is this to beleeue the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> of ſinnes? or is it not rather to denie the Lord Ieſus that hath bought vs? For I may ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> if righteouſneſſe come by the law (or by our ſatisfaction) then Chriſt died in vaine. And with what face can theſe men accuſe vs of denying this article, the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, themſelues teaching ſuch blaſphemous doctrine, ſo manifeſtly oppoſite and contrarie vnto it? Againe, they denie the forgiueneſſe of the puniſhments due for ſinne, ſaying, that Chriſt hath deliuered vs <hi>à culpa,</hi> from the fault or offence, but not <hi>à poena</hi> from the puniſhment; or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hee hath deliuered vs from eternall puniſhment, but not from temporall, which muſt bee ſuſtained in Puga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, whereby our ſinnes or ſoules muſt bee purged, and Gods iuſtice ſatisfied. And yet the Popes pardons, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and dirges may diſcharge and deliuer from it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firſt, what doe they but extenuate, and greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the vertue and powre of Chriſts death? For if our Sauiour Chriſt haue not deliuered vs from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to our ſinnes, what great good hath hee done vs? And if hee haue diſcharged vs from eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hell, but not from the temporall in Purgatory, then is hee not a full and perfect Sauiour, but an halfe Sauiour. Haue you the teſtimonie of all Antiquitie for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Exempto ſcilicet reatu, eximi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By this let it be diſcerned who they bee that<note place="margin">Auguſt. de vera relig. cap. 13</note> denie that article of the forgiueneſſe of ſinne. Moreouer, let the Chriſtian reader conſider how they attribute firſt that to their Purgatory, which is proper to the bloud of Chriſt, which, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, clenſeth vs from all ſinne: and ſecondly, more to their Dirges, Maſſes, Pardons, and ſuch<note place="margin">1.

For they may deliuer from the paines of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but Chriſts death doth not. <hi>O coelum non ſudas! ô terra, non tremis! &amp;.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now let vs come to your proofe of this your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of our denying of this article. Your firſt reaſon is, that wee acknowledge no ſuch effect in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, &amp;c. Wee acknowledge that baptiſme is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, by the death and paſſion of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whereby our faith is confirmed, and we aſſured, that as water waſheth away the filth of the bodie, ſo all the filth &amp; guiltineſſe of our ſinnes is ſo purged in the bloud of Chriſt, that wee bee accepted for iuſt and righteous before God. But we do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Baptiſme, or any other Sacrament, doe conferre grace of themſelues, or haue grace included in them as in a veſſell: but wee affiame that they bee ſeales of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and inſtruments whereby God worketh in his elect and choſen people thoſe graces, which hee hath in his word promiſed, and Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for them. But all that bee outwardly baptized, bee not inwardlie clenſed, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who beeing baptized, was yet<note place="margin">Act. 8. 23.</note> ſtill in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquitie. For the ſpirit of God worketh by them in whom, when and how much it pleaſeth him. Neither doe wee beleeue that Baptiſme ſerueth onely for the remiſſion of ſinnes committed before it, as you ſay here, but that the vſe and benefit of it, pertaineth to our whole life, continually to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7248:47"/> for that in it the ſoule dead by ſinne is newly regenerate by grace: I anſwere that Baptiſme is ſo farre from beeing in this place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed, that it is not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither neceſſarily to bee vnderſtanded. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſweete words bee theſe: <hi>When the hountifulneſſe and loue of God our Sauiour towards man appeared, not by the workes of</hi>

                  <p>Your ſecond proofe is, that we allow not the ſacrament of Penance, wherein all actuall ſinnes committed after Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me are cancelled.

                  <p>The third things whereby you would proue that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie this article of remiſſion of ſinnes, which you ſay <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all in abſurditie, is that wee denie that our ſinnes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly forgiuen, but onely not imputed, and as it were veiled or couered with the paſſion of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Now I come to the fourth Article that you ſay the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans in effect deny, which is no leſſe, then Chriſt to bee the Sonne of God.

The Father the firſt cauſe in order, and the beginning of all things; the Sonne his wiſedome and euerlaſting word: the holy Ghoſt his true power and efficacy. The Sonne begotten of the Father from euerlasting: the holy Ghost from euerlaſting proceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne: which three perſons are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, but diſtinct; and yet not deuided, but coëſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, coëternall, and coëquall.</hi> If you miſlike any thing in this confeſſion confute it: if you know any of vs that

But you ſay that theſe (whom you tearme puritanes) perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affirme, that Chriſt is God of himſelfe, and not God of God: So that he receiueth not his diuinity from his father.

Where-unto I anſwere, that Chriſt was farre from ſuch deſpaire, which properly is a ſinne in the reprobate, and not a puniſhment of Gods iuſtice. And we hould that our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffered in our perſon, and for vs thoſe torments, which are righteous puniſhments of GODS iuſtice againſt ſinne, and not ſuch as properly bee ſinnes in the deuils, and in wicked and reprobate men, as are deſpaire and hatred of God. And therefore we confeſſe with our mouthes, and beleeue with our hearts, that Chriſt was neuer hated of his Father, but alwaies the deerely beloued Sonne of God, in whome he was alwayes well
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7248:51"/> pleaſed. But hee hated ſinne, the which as man had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſo in mans nature Gods iuſtice was to be ſatisfied. The which for that corrupt and ſinfull man was not able to performe, the Sonne of God as I ſaid, became our ſurety, tooke vpon him our nature, and in the ſame hath ſuffered vpon the croſſe, the puniſhment of Gods anger due to our ſinnes, and thereby hath ſatisfied Gods iuſtice, pacified his anger, and purchaſed his loue and mercy to all thoſe that truly beleeue in him. And ſo Chriſt was tormented with anguiſh of minde, nor for his ſinnes, as you falſely gather, but for out ſinnes, which hee bare in his body and ſoule vpon the croſſe: and God was not enemy to God, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to our ſinnes, which were imputed to Chriſt, that his ſatisfaction and righteouſnes might bee imputed vnto vs; To conclude we beleeue that Chriſt ſuffered vpon the croſſe thoſe puniſhments of ſinne which proceede from Gods iuſtice, and be no ſinnes, which in ſome ſenſe may be called the paines of hell, the which as Chriſt by his Deitie ouercame, and it was impoſſible for him to be held and ouercome of them: ſo the diuell and the reprobate ſhall eternally indure them. And this is no diſperate doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but a moſt comfortable doctrine to aſſure vs, that in Chriſt Gods iuſtice is ſatisfied, our ſinnes are diſcharged, hell is conquered, and wee from it be deliuered.

                     </gap>icence to condemne him, for obſtinately maintaining the contrarie, to bee an Heretike, &amp; the reaſon is euident for the rule &amp; ſquare that Proteſtantes and Puritans both hold to know an hereſie is this, whatſoeuer is contrarie to Gods word is an hereſie, if it be obſtinatly defended: but all the foreſaid ſeauen points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie are by the one part prooued contrarie to Gods word, and by the other auouched to bee grounded vpon the ſame, therefore we may well conclude that if one error in faith with obſtinacie defended ſufficeth to make an heretike, what ſhal we iudge of the Puritane who ſo manly defendeth ſo many? Sure this I will auerr that they differ in ſubſtance of Religion, and not onely in accidents and ceremonies. And finally, they haue no argument to prooue, that they haue the true Church, true Religion, true faith, which all heretikes which euer were, wil not bring to condemne the Church as well as they. For example, they alleadge Scriptures, ſo did the <hi>Arrians:</hi> they contemne Councels, the <hi>Arrians</hi> did not regard them: they challenge to themſelues the true interpretation, the ſame did all heretikes to this day.</q> And to conclude, they call themſelues the little flocke
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7248:53"/> of Chriſt, to whome God hath reuealed his truth, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from aboue, all which the Donatiſts with as good reaſon, and better arguments did arrogate vnto themſelues. The ſame I ſay of Pelagians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, with all the rabble of other damned heretikes. And to conclude theſe articles of faith, I ſay that if the principles of the Proteſtants religion be true, Saint Paul himſelfe exhorteth vs to infidelity, which I proue thus.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer exhorteth vs to doubt of that which we are bound to beleeue by faith, exhorteth to infidelity. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort vs to doubt of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we are bound to beleeue by faith, according to the Proteſtants religion. ergo, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs to infidelity.</p>

                  <p>Whereas you note in your margent the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus, and Chalcedon, wherin old heretikes were confuted and condemned: and thereby claime them to appertaine to your Church. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as it is moſt certaine, that thoſe Councels were not called, nor gouerned and directed by the Biſhops of Rome, as now by vſurpation they are; ſo you ſhall neuer proue, that thoſe Godly and learned fathers agreed with you in many great and principall points of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

For wee are to aske forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, becauſe God doth command it, and require it of vs. Moreouer, it is our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to aske forgiueneſſe of them: for otherwiſe we cannot be aſſured by faith that they be forgiuen vs: for by asking pardon of them, wee do make confeſſion of them, and doe acknowledge our owne guiltines, the which if we ſhould refuſe to doe, we can haue no aſſurance of the remiſſion of them.

And yet wee muſt pray in a true perſwaſion of faith of Gods mercy towards vs to the forgiuenes of our ſinnes not onely paſt, but alſo future and to come. and ſo our praying for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them, is a crauing of the continuance of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to the continuall pardoning of them, which we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually commit.</p>

Moreouer (as we ſaid before) for as much as we daily ſin &amp; offend God, we ought daily to craue Gods mercy in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our ſinnes. What likenes hath praier for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde, or for the incarnation of Chriſt, &amp;c. herewith? And whereas this man thinketh it ſo abſurd a thing to pray to God to forgiue vs our ſinnes, becauſe we beleeue the forgiuenes of them I would aske of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. <hi>Paul</hi> praying both in the beginning, and in the end of his Epiſtles, for Gods grace to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull, did not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly beleeue, that they were euen then, &amp; before thoſe his prayers indued with Gods grace?

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7248:71"/> mercy accept our workes as pure and perfect in Chriſt-Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7248:72"/> whome ſinne remayneth, but raigneth not) are in Chriſt acceptable to GOD, and profitable to men. But this acceptation and profit commeth not of the pureneſſe, and perfection, and merite of our owne workes: but in that the ſpottes and imperfection of them are by Chriſtes righteouſneſſe couered, for his name ſake pardoned, and in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him accepted for pure and perfect. For euen as men looking through a glaſſe, be it greene, blew, or any ſuch other coullor, the thing vnder it ſeemes to bee of the ſame coullor the glaſſe is: euen ſo GOD our heauenly Father looking vppon his elect and faithfull people through his Sonne <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> in whome hee is well pleaſed, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and take them with their workes for ſuch as <hi>IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST</hi> is.

                  <p>Whereas fiftly you charge vs, that wee deny the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance, thereby to make men careles how they liue: I anſwer, that although we deny your penance to be a Sacrament, becauſe it hath no outward viſible ſigne, and reiect your clancular confeſſion, your abſurd abſolution, and your ſurperſtitious or rather blaſphemous ſatisfaction, thereby to anſwere Gods iuſtice, and diſcharge your ſins: yet we truly teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of repentance, as it is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs in the word of God. We teach men to come to the knowledge of their ſins, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God, which is the<note place="margin">Rom 3.</note> glaſſe to ſhew vs our ſpots, &amp; the firſt ſtep to repentance: then to lament their ſinnes, whereby they haue offended their gracious God, and mercifull father; to confeſſe their ſinnes with remorſe of conſcience, both to God and men, whom they haue offended: and eſpecially wee call vpon men for amendement of life, in bringing forth fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of repentance, without the which there is no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. One part of which amendement is ſatisfaction to our brethren for iniuries committed and reſtitution of goods vnlawfully and vngoldly gotten.

                     <hi>Mantuan</hi> here ſheweth, firſt, that many in thoſe daies miſliked that law of vowing ſingle life. Secondly, that it had bred many monſters, that is to ſay, ſuch as for their wickedneſſe did lead a monſtrous life. Thirdly, that the life of the auncient Fathers that liued in marriage, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then of theſe which vowed chaſtitie. <hi>Polidorus Virgilius</hi> an Italian, and gatherer of the Popes Peter penſe here in England, writeth thus: <hi>Illud tamen dixerim tantum abfuiſſe</hi>

Wherefore peraduenture it were expedient, both for the Chriſtian common wealth, and the eſtate of that order of Prieſthood, that at the laſt the right of publike marriage were reſtored to Prieſts, which they might holyly vſe without infamie, rather then moſt filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defile themſelues with ſuch a natural vice. Such a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and filthines of life, this doctrine of vowing chaſtitie, and forſaking matrimony hath brought forth: whereof much more might be alleaged, but this ſhall ſuffice. Yet herevunto I wil adde not only their practiſe, but alſo their doctrine of hauing <hi>Lupanaria,</hi> ſtewes, where whoredome is publikely permitted: for the reſtoring of which, Fryer <hi>Perine</hi> preached at Paules Croſſe in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſut.

                  <p>Another doctrine of theirs tending to looſeneſſe and wickedneſſe of life, is their doctrine of Popes pardons, whereby they falſely faine, that the Pope hauing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Martyrs (which they cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſure of the Church) to diſpenſe and beſtowe at his pleaſure, hee can pardon whatſoeuer ſinne men haue committed, and acquit and diſcharge them both <hi>à poena &amp; culpa:</hi> that is from the ſin and puniſhment, which is more by their doctrine, then the death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt can do.

               </p>
               <p>The Proteſtants make God the cauſe and author of ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Maior I proue: for if God perſwade or impell men to ſinne, as for example: <hi>Iudas</hi> to ſell Chriſt, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to deny Chriſt, the Iewes to crucifie Chriſt: queſtionleſſe he intended the ſacriledge of Iudas, the negation of Peter, the murder of the Iewes: and this much more effectually then <hi>Iudas, Peter,</hi> or the Iewes. For who can reſiſt his impulſion? or who can fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his intention? <hi>Voluntati eius quis reſiſtet?</hi> Who is able to oppoſe himſelfe againſt his will? yea what man is he, that in conſcience were not bound to conforme his will vnto the will of God, who is the author of all good willes, and the firſt rule and ſquare of all regular wils. <hi>Iudas, Peter,</hi> and the Iewes, if they had followed the motions of God, who could haue blamed them, for following him, who could not erre in impelling, nor ſinne in perſwading them?</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, that God moued them for a good end: <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet,</hi> the redemption of man, and they intended an ill end: to wit, Luere, reuenge, or ſome other ſiniſter effect. Yet this ſhif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> will not ſalue the ſore, for euill may not be done, that good may follow. <hi>Non ſunt facienda mala vt inde veniant bona:</hi> For<note place="margin">Rom. 3. ver. 8.</note> otherwiſe a man might ſteale to giue almes, be arunke for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, commit ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>utrie to beget children.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, why might not <hi>Iudas, Peter</hi> or the Iewes, intend that good end which God intended, and yet haue ſolde, denied, and crucified Chriſt conforming their intentions to his, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruments and he the firſt meouer?</p>
               <p>Againe it cannot be ſaid, but that God indirectly, and moſt effectually intended their ſinnes; for he that intendeth any effect wherewith another effect is neceſſarily conioyned, conſequently intendeth it: as for example: He that intendeth to burne a ſhip
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7248:99"/> in the midſt of the ſea, intendeth conſequently the death of all the men which be in her. In like manner, if God intended that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould ſell Chriſt, vnto which action ſinne was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily adioyned, conſequently God intended the ſinne as well as the ſelling.</p>
               <p>The Minor is too too euident. For the Proteſtants deride Gods permiſsion, they ſay that all his actions are energeticall, or effectuall: they desperately auerre, that <hi>Pauls</hi> conuerſion, and <hi>Dauids</hi> aduoutrie, were in like manner the workes of God: And as he elected ſome to glorie, before the preuiſion of workes; ſo he reiected ſome from glorie before the preuiſion of ſins. Here hence I infer, that according to the Proteſtants principles, God is moſt properly the author of ſinne, becauſe he impelleth most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thereunto.</p>
               <p>Next, that he is the only author of ſinne, for that he inforceth men vpon neceſsitie to ſinne, and they as inſtruments follow the motion of their firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, that man ſinneth not; for where there is neceſsitie of ſinning, there is no ſinne, for ſinne is free or no ſinne: beſides, how can man ſinne in conforming his will with Gods will?</p>
               <p>Finally, God is worſe then the diuell: for that the wickednes of the diuell, principally conſiſteth in moouing, perſwading, and iuducing of men to ſinne: the which by the Proteſtants confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ſſe reſiſtable, then the illuſions or ſuggeſtions of the diuell.</p>
               <p>Many ſinnes moreouer are acted without the temptations of the diuell, ſome of ignorance, ſome of paſsion, but none without the motions of God: ſo that God is worſe then the diuell, both in cauſing a greater multitude of ſinnes then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The which doctrine is as good a ground for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme as euer hell could deuiſe: for were it not much more reaſonable to ſay there were no God at all, then to beleeue there were ſuch a God, as commaundeth, perſwadeth, vrgeth, impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men to ſinne; and yet for the ſame ſinnes will torment them with the inexplicable paines of hell?</p>

                  <p>Touching Gods preuiſion, you write as though you neither did know what we teach, nor regard what your ſelfe doe write. Doe we teach that God elected ſome to

We doe not teach that God ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted any to glory before hee did foreſee their workes. For from euerlaſting, he (to whom all things be preſent) did foreſee both the good workes of his elect, and the wicked works of the reprobate. But this we ſay, that the foundation and cauſe of Gods election and reprobation is not his preſcience and foreſeeing of the good workes of the one, and the wicked workes of the other, but his owne purpoſe, will, and pleaſure, and that good workes be not cauſes of Gods election, but fruits and effects of it.

                  <p>Now I come to your illations, which vpon theſe falſe aſſertions you falſly inferre. To the firſt I anſwere, that God impelleth no man to ſinne, and therefore God is not the author of ſinne. Secondly, God inforceth not men vpon neceſſitie to ſinne, but they ſinne willingly, and by the inſtigation of the diuell, who worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience: therefore God is not the author of ſinne. In your third inference, where you ſay, that ſinne is free, or no ſinne: belike you hold with <hi>Pighius,</hi> &amp; ſome other Papiſts, that originall ſinne is no ſinne: for it is not free for vs to be without it. And whereas you aske, how man can ſinne, in conforming his will with Gods will: I anſwere, that they that ſinne, doe not conforme their will

               <p>The Maior is a principle vndoubted of in the ſchooles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: for they peremptorily affirme that true faith (ſuch as was in <hi>Dauid</hi> one of Gods elected) can n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Minor I prooue: for whoſoeuer remaineth in death is without charitie: but <hi>Dauid</hi> when hee killed <hi>Vrias</hi> remained in death: Ergo, <hi>Dauid</hi> when he killed <hi>Vrias</hi> was without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. If hee was without that which once he had, no doubt but then he loſt it, for he was depriued thereof for his ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Maior propoſition of this last Syllogiſme thus I proue: for charitie is the life of the ſoule, and it is as impoſſible for a man to haue charitie and remaine in death, as it is impoſsible to be dead in bodie, and yet indued with a reaſonable ſoule.</p>
               <p>The Minor cannot be denied (to wit, that <hi>Dauid</hi> by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Vrias</hi> remained in death:) for it is the expreſſe vvord of God; <hi>Qui non diligit manet in morte;</hi> He that loueth not<note place="margin">1.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias</hi> to be killed, loſt his charitie. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this combat betweene the ſpirit and the fleſh in <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ſpirit retired, and the fleſh preuailed; the new man was foyled, and the olde man ouercame: yet was not the ſpirit vtterly extinguiſhed, nor the new man cleane killed. Indeede <hi>Dauids</hi> faith fainted, his charity was cooled, and his other gifts and graces couered, yet not cleane quenched: but there remained ſparks of Gods ſpirit, which afterwards being ſtirred vp, and blowne by <hi>Nathans</hi> bellowes kindled &amp; flamed to Gods glory, and <hi>Dauids</hi> eternall comfort and ſaluation. Shall we thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> had loſt all loue of God, of his law &amp; of man? was he cleane depriued of Gods ſpirit? it appeareth by his owne words that hee was not. Who vpon <hi>Nathans</hi> preaching and reprouing of his ſinne, prayed and ſaid: <hi>Take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi> Whereupon I reaſon thus:<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 11.</note> He that was not cleane depriued of Gods ſpirit, had not wholly loſt faith and charity: But <hi>Dauid</hi> was not cleane depriued of Gods ſpirit; therefore he had not wholly loſt faith and charitie. The firſt propoſition is euident by the words of <hi>Dauid:</hi> the ſecond is manifeſt. For it is abſurd to ſay, that the ſpirit of God ſhould continue in him, that hath loſt all graces and gifts of the ſpirit. It is with Gods elect and choſen children, as it is with fire which in the night is ſo hid and couered, that none appeareth; and yet in the morning is ſtirred vp, and is made to brune and to flame: and as with a tree, which in the Winter hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruite nor leafe vpon it; yet it hath a ſap fallen into the root, which in the ſpring ſpringeth, &amp; bringeth forth both leafe and fruite: So is it with Gods holy Saints, they be ſometimes ſo ouertaken and ouercome with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that they ſeeme to be as trees without fruite, withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and periſhed: yet there remaineth a ſap of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

And therefore to the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your ſecond Syllogiſme I ſay, that although <hi>Dauid</hi> by thoſe foule &amp; fearefull offences deſerued eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death: yet he did not remaine in death; and although God hated thoſe ſinnes, yet hee neuer hated <hi>Dauid.</hi> For <hi>whom God loueth, he loueth to the end, and the gifts and calling</hi>

                     <hi>of God are without repentance.</hi> If we loue a man, and yet hate ſome ſinne that he committeth, might not God, who is loue it ſelfe, hate <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne, and yet loue him, and keepe ſome ſparkes of his ſpirit and grace in him, and ſo preſerue as the externall life of the body, ſo the internall life of the ſoule in him? So that neither <hi>Dauid</hi> remained in death, neither was his loue, no not to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias</hi> altogether extinguiſhed in him.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7248:105"/> this is attributed to faith, becauſe by it Chriſt dwelleth in vs, and wee by it be put into the poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and of all the benefites of his paſſion. Concerning the place of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> becauſe you doe not vrge it, I will not ſtand vpon it. We doubt not, but men may and doe fall from God and iuſt actions vnto wicked and vngodly deeds, and may haue a temporall faith, and fall away from the grace of God. But this we ſay, that true faith in Gods elect, which are ſealed with the ſpirit of adoption,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and to whoſe ſpirit Gods ſpirit doth beare witneſſe, that they are the ſonnes of God, is neuer wholly loſt in them, and the ſame ſpirit worketh by charity, which in them may be cooled, but neuer cleane quenched. But of the loſing of faith, and of the coniunction thereof with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, I haue before intreated.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne this argument in ſome ſort vpon you: Whereas the Papiſts auerre, that the Popes faith cannot faile, I reaſon thus: He that loſeth his charitie, may loſe his faith: the Pope may loſe his charitie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope may loſe his faith. The firſt propoſition I haue proued alreadie, and haue ſhewed that true faith is not ſeparated from charitie, but worketh by it. And moſt manifeſt it is by Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> that the faith which is without charitie,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 26.</note> and good works is dead: So that if the Pope be without charitie, then he hath but a dead faith. And a dead faith, is as much faith, as a dead man is a man. That the Pope may be without charitie, I thinke they will not denie: and if they doe, it may be prooued by many examples. <note n="a" place="margin">Platina in Ioan. 13.

               <p>AS touching the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Chriſts body &amp; bloud, which is commonly called the Communion, becauſe it is a pledge vnto vs of that Communion and fellowſhip which wee haue both with our Sauiour Chriſt, and alſo one with another, two kinde of things are to be conſidered.

Of the former ſort is the hauing of bread and wine, the diſtribution of the ſame to them that be preſent, prayer, and thankeſgiuing in a knowne tongue, that all with one mouth and heart may giue thankes to God for his great and infinite mercies towards vs, in nor ſparing, but giuing his owne deare ſonne for vs euen his body to be broken vpon the Croſſe, and his bloud to be ſhed for our ſaluation, whereof the bread and wine is a Sacrament, that is to ſay, a holy ſigne, remembrance, and pledge vnto vs, yea and a meane and inſtrument, whereby wee are made partakers of Chriſtes body and bloud giuen for vs, and of all the benefits of his paſſion. Theſe things be of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, and ought alwaies to be vſed, and may not be altered. Other things there be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall, as the time and place of miniſtring the ſame, the habit or tire to be vſed of the Miniſter, the forme of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and thankſgiuing in reſpect of the words. Theſe and

As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Real preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, if you meane thereby not a Real preſence of Chriſt to the faith of the godly and worthy receiuer, (whereby wee affirme and beleeue, that hee doth truely receiue Ieſus Chriſt, and doth eate his fleſh and drinke his blood, to the feeding and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſoule to eternall life, but an euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſubſtance of the bread and wine, and the turning and tranſubſtantiating of the ſame into the very naturall body and bloud of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder the outward accidents of bread and wine; concerning this falſe, groſſe, and carnall doctrine, I haue ſaid ſufficiently in a printed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, publiſhed twentie yeares paſt, and as yet not

As for example: <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> offered either of them a Sacrifice; the one of the fruit of his field, the other of the increaſe of his cattell; there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before God in the outward ſacrifice, yet the one was accepted, and the other was reiected, becauſe the one was a godly and faithfull man that did offer it, and the other a wicked Hypocrite; and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that by faith <hi>Abel</hi> offered a greater ſacrifice<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 4.</note> then <hi>Caine</hi> did.</p>

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the ſame Sacrfices offred by the wicked Iewes, which were a ſinfull nation, a people laden with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the ſeede of the wicked, corrupt children, which<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.</note> had forſaken the Lord, and prouoked the holy one of Iſrael to anger, whoſe hands were full of blood;<note place="margin">15</note> were ſo odious and abominable to GOD, that he ſaith of them, What haue I to doe with the multitude<note place="margin">2</note> of your ſacrifices, ſaith the Lord; I am full of the burnt offerings of Rammes; and the fat of fedde beaſtes. And a little after: Bring no more oblations in vaine, incenſe is an obhomination vnto mee. Yea GOD ſaith of thoſe ſacrifices in another place, Hee that killeth a Bullocke is as if hee ſlewe a man; hee that ſacrificeth a ſheepe, is as if hee cut off a dogges necke; hee that offereth an oblation is as if hee had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered<note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 3.</note> ſwines blood: he that remembreth incenſe, is as if he had bleſſed an idoll, &amp;c. Why did God thus abhor
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7248:122"/> theſe ſacrifices, which he himſelfe! had commanded to bee offered? euen becauſe they were wicked men, voide of true faith and repentance, which did offer them. And to come nearer to the purpoſe, why was the ſacrifice of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt vpon the Croſſe a ſweete ſmelling ſacrifice to God; to pacifice his wrath, to ſatisfie his iuſtice, and to purchaſe his mercy vnto vs? ſurely becauſe Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God did offer it, as before is declared. And therefore it muſt in like manner follow, that if a miſerable man could offer Ieſus Chriſt, for a ſacrifice to his Father, then Chriſt ſhould bee accepted for the mans ſake, the which if it be falſe and blaſphemous, then can no man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp Ieſus Chriſt for a propitiatory ſacrifice to his Father.

                  <hi>man after hee had offered one ſacrifice for ſinne, ſitteth for euer at the right hand of God.</hi> Thus wee ſee that the holy ſcripture teacheth vs, that our Sauiour Chriſt once offered himſelfe, once entred into the holy place, with one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation once made hath ſanctified vs, and ſo can neuer bee repeated. And if this ſacrifice ſhould bee repeated, and our Sauiour Chriſt ſhould daily be offered in the Maſſe, ſee what abſurdities would follow. Firſt that the ſacrifice of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7248:123"/> our Sauiour Chriſt vpon the Croſſe were weake, imperfect and inſufficient to take away ſinne: for ſo the Apoſtle doth reaſon, &amp; doth proue, that the ſacrifices of the Iewes were not perfect, and were vnable to take away ſinnes, becauſe they were ſtill repeated, and ceaſed not to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. By the which reaſon, it ſhould follow, that if our Sauiour Chriſt be often and continually offered, then his ſacrifice which he offered vpon the Croſſe was imperfect, and vnable to take away ſin: which if it be falſe and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to affirme, then Chriſt is not continually to bee offered in the Maſſe. And herevpon I doe make an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe ſacrifices which ceaſe not to be offered for ſinne, cannot purge ſinne: but the ſacrifice of the Maſſe ceaſeth not to be offered for ſinne; therefore the ſacrifice of the Maſſe cannot purge ſinne. The firſt propoſition of this ſyllogiſme is proued by the Apoſtle. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 12. as I haue before declared. The ſecond propoſition cannot of them bee denied, as I would it might: and therefore the concluſion muſt needes follow, or otherwiſe I make the argument thus. That ſacrifice which is perfect, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take away ſinnes, is not to bee repeated: but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe was perfect and able to take away ſinnes: therefore the ſacrifice of Chriſt is not to be repeated.</p>
               <p>An other abſurdity would follow, that if Chriſt bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 25.</note> offered in the Maſſe, then he doth often ſuffer and die, for ſo the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>not that he ſhould offer himſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as the high prieſt entreth into the holy place euery yeare with ſtrange bloud, for then muſt he haue often ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world, &amp;c?</hi> but Chriſt doth not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuffer and die <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. therefore hee is not often offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Another reaſon I will vſe againſt the fained ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſſe in this ſort: Without ſheding of bloud there is no forgiueneſſe of ſinne: but in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, there is no ſhedding of bloud, therefore by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe, there is no forgiueneſſe of ſinne, and ſo conſequently it is no ſacrifice propitiatory for the ſins of the quicke and the dead. The firſt propoſition is the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7248:123"/> very words of the Apoſtle. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. the ſecond they doe grant themſelues in calling it an vnbloudy ſacrifice, and therefore the concuſion cannot be denied. My laſt reaſon ſhall be this.</p>
               <p>Where there is forgiueneſſe of ſinne, there is no more<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 18.</note> offering for ſinne, but by the ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe wee haue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, therefore thereis no more offering for ſinne. The firſt propoſition is the words of the Apoſtle, the ſecond I hope this Catholike Gentlewoman and her fauourers will not deny, therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> concluſion muſt needs be true, &amp; ſo conſequently y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſacrifice of the Maſſe is iuſtly aboliſhed. But me thinke I heare this Catholike gentlewoman exclaming and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what haue we now no ſacrifices in the church as you would ſeeme here to conclude? I anſwere that wee haue, but not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſacrifices of thankſgiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby wee ſhew forth our thankefulneſſe to God for his great mercie towards vs, in not ſparing, but giuing his owne deare ſonne to death for vs: of theſe ſacrifices wee reade. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4 5. and 50. 22. and 51 18. <hi>Heb. 13. 15. 16. 1.

And of this ſort is the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Sauiour Chriſt, which though it bee properly a ſacrament and not a ſacrifice, yet of ſome of the Ancient fathers it is called a ſacrifice, becauſe it is a holy ſigne and pledge vnto vs of that ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice which Ieſus Chriſt vpon the croſſe offered for our redemption &amp; ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becauſe in celebrating and receiuing of it, we do giue thankes to God for the ſame, for the which cauſe (as I ſaid before) it is called <hi>Euchariſtia,</hi> that is to ſay thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.

               <p>AS touching theſe here charged with hereſie, to whom you ſeeke to liken vs, firſt I anſwere general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that neither whatſoeuer an heretike hath holden is to be counted hereſie, for there hath beene no heretike, but he hath held ſome truth; nor whatſoeuer a Godly father of the church hath maintained, is to be eſteemed for truth and verity, for it is not vnknowne, that the ancient God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers had their infirmities, and were ſubiect to ſome errors. The which although by particuler examples might be declared, yet at this preſent I will ſpare them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a doctrine is not ſimply either to be reiected, becauſe an Heritike held it: nor to bee imbraced, becauſe a Godly father maintained it: But if it be agreeable to the word of God, it is to be receiued: if it diſſent from it though an Angell from heauen deliuer it, wee are to refuſe it. But<note place="margin">Epiph: hereſſ. 75. Augu. de her. cap. 53.</note> perticulerly to come to thoſe perſons here named, I doe confeſſe that <hi>Aerius</hi> was an Heretike in maintayning the horrible hereſie of <hi>Arius,</hi> wherewith <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> do charge him. But whereas they did obiect vnto him the denying of praier for the dead, firſt I ſay, that they doe not conuince and confute him by the ſcriptures. And therefore let this Gentlewoman or ſome of her fauorers performe that, which they haue ommitted, and plainely proue this doctrine of praying for the dead by the holie canonicall ſcriptures, and then wee will grant the deniall of it to be an heriſie, and <hi>Aerius</hi> for the ſame to haue beene an Heritike. Secondly I ſay that that praier for the dead which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> do meane, neither doth prooue purgatorie, nor is the ſame which the Papiſts doe<note place="margin">Hereſ. 75.</note> now vſe. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> rendring a reaſon of their praiets for the dead, doth not ſay, that they praied for them, that they might haue remiſſion of ſuch ſinnes, as were not here forgiuen them, nor to make ſatisfaction for their ſinnes, and to releaſe them out of the paines of purgatory, (for the Greeke Church, (whereof <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was) neuer to this daie beleeued purgatorie) but hee
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7248:128"/> giueth this reaſon thereof, that they which bee aliue ſhould thinke and hope, that they which bee departed<note place="margin">

The ancient Church alſo praied for the Virgine<note place="margin">Litu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Mary,</hi> for the Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs, whom I hope this Catholike gentlewoman will not beleeue to haue beene in purgatory. And therefore that kinde of praier for the dead which in the ancient Church was vſed, was rather a commemoration of them, and thankſgiuing for them, then a petition to deliuer them from the fained fire of purgatory, and ſo prooueth neither pick purſe purgatorie, nor that popiſh praier for the dead, which is now vſed and maintained. And thus much tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Aerius.</hi>

               <p>You alſo ſay that you haue beene told that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was aboue a thouſand yeares paſt condemned for an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike for denying praier vnto Saints.

But it is one thing for the Saints in heauen to pray for vs, and another for vs to pray vnto them. Though the former could bee prooued (as by the holy ſcriptures it cannot) yet the other is not there vpon to be inferred or graunted. Laſtly I ſay that if <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> (whom many Biſhoppes of his time did fauour) did deny praier to Saints, yet vntill you haue effectually both confuted my reaſons afore ſet downe, and proued your doctrine by the ſcriptures, wee will neither condemne it for Hereſie, nor count him therefore an Heretike. As touching the Nouatian heretikes, who denied repentance to them that after baptiſme did fall, wee abhorre their hereſie, and wiſh that the papiſts were as free from the poyſon of them, as we be. The Nouatians gloried in their merites: and ſo doe the Papiſts. The Nouatians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſecond marriages, and ſo doe Papiſtes in ſome: in that one may not bee a prieſt that hath beene twiſe married. The Nouatians re-baptiſed thoſe that after Baptiſme did fall and publikely offend: and ſo doe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in corners baptiſe ſuch as haue beene baptized in our Churches, which is an error condemned aboue a thouſand yeares agoe.</p>
               <p>You would haue vs to bee like <hi>Euſtathius</hi> in denying pilgrimages to holy places.

That no purgatory can be found, that it is a vaine thing to pray for the dead, and an inuention of couetous Prieſtes. That the images of God and Saintes are to bee deſtroyed. That the bleſſinge of water and palmes is to be derided. That the orders of begging Freers were inuented by the diuell, that Prieſts ought to be poore, and be content onely with almes.

That auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is friuolous, and that it is ſufficient for men to confeſſe their ſinnes vnto God in their chamber. That baptiſme is to be vſed in water without mixture of hollowed oile.

That the praiers of Saints raigning with Chriſt in heauen
